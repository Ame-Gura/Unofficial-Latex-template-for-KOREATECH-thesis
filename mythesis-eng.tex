\begin{appendixformatted}
	\section{Appendix Structure}
	In \LaTeX, appendices are typically treated as chapters. Therefore, if further division within an appendix is needed, then use the \verb|\section| command appropriately.
	The appendix section in this template has also been designed in accordance with \cite{ThesisGuide}.
	If your thesis does not include any appendices, then you may delete or comment out all the appendix-related code in this template.
	
	\section{Numbering}
	All appendix numbering starts with the letter A.
	For example, the numbering of equations appears as follows.
	\begin{align}
		\int_0^{2\pi} \sin x \,dx = 0.
	\end{align}
	Likewise, the numbering of figures is as follows.
	\begin{figure*}[h]
		\centering%
		\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{example-image-a}
		\caption{A figure example in the Appendix}
	\end{figure*}
	
	This \LaTeX~template guide for KoreaTech theses ends here.
	I hope this guide and template support your smooth and successful thesis submission.
